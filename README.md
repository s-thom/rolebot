rolebot

A quick Discord bot to manage roles on a server. In no way full featured. This was just a quick project to fill a need.

---

Requires a config.json:

```json
{
  "token": "<your Discord bot token>",
  "overlords": [
    "[ID of user that always has permissions]"
  ],
  "servers": {}
}
```
